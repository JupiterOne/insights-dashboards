# User Access

![sample-screenshot](board.png)

Show users across different environments/accounts, admin users, and shared/system user accounts.

Within the 'Admin Users' widget, it also includes an additional query to find
users that are assigned to roles which are tied to administrative IAM access
policies. This is in addition to the first query that is finding users who
are deemed to be administrators based on the type/role attribute directly on
the user.

> Prerequisite: 
>
> This works best when integrations to different providers and accounts are 
> as complete as possible.
